# AttendanceManagementSystem
A system that allows marking attendance by matching MD5-Hash keys of images and provides CSV files for easy transfer.<br>
A simple client-side system to take attendane and add students to a roll call. Designed to be a biometric-attendance system. A decent web-UI but the image matching is really minimalistic. Only same images generate same MD5's, so need some approximation measure. Not Implemented.
